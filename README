#Knee MRI ACL Tear Classifier
This script implements a deep learning model for classifying knee MRI images as showing a torn ACL or not.

#Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the KneeMRI dataset, which consists of knee MRI images that can show whether the image shows a torn ACL or not. The dataset can be found in the kneemridataset directory.

#Preprocessing
The images are preprocessed using filters to remove noise and enhance the features of the image. The preprocessed images are then split into a testing and training dataset.

#Model
The model used for classification is a convolutional neural network (CNN) built using Keras with a TensorFlow backend. The model has been refined by adjusting the hyperparameters and increasing the learning rate to improve its performance.

#Deployment
Once the model has been trained and performs well, it can be deployed to classify new knee MRI images as either having an ACL tear or not.

#Dependencies
The script requires the following dependencies:

NumPy
Pandas
TensorFlow
Keras
Usage
To run the script, ensure that the kneemridataset directory is present in the same directory as the script, and run the following command:

#Copy Code
python knee_mri_classifier.py
The script will preprocess the images, train the model, and output the results of the classification on the test dataset.
